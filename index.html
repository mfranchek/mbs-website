    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Model Based Solutions (MBS) is a private digital systems technology company advancing the profitability and market share of our customers using data-driven adaptive models and adaptive learning simulation design. Our engineering-efficient process is powered by a proprietary digital twin inventory and software stack. With 25+ years of success in industries like biomedical, oil & gas, automotive, and heavy equipment, our validated multi-physics models (mechanical, electrical, thermal, and fluid) are built to deliver.

    <h2>Revolutionizing System Monitoring with Adaptive Models</h2>
    <p>
      Our flagship product delivers real-time adaptation of models derived from your operational data. As your system runs, these models update dynamically, extracting hidden patterns, identifying early degradation signs, and delivering high-confidence forecasts — all without requiring failure data. Embedded directly at the edge or integrated into your server/cloud, our algorithms deliver clarity, speed, and security.

    <h2>Why Model Based Solutions?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Our models are physics-based, not black-box, ensuring trust and interpretability.</li>
      <li>Solutions run on the edge or cloud — you choose the deployment architecture.</li>
      <li>Two-step model validation confirms authenticity with simulation + data-driven methods.</li>
      <li>Highly efficient: solutions delivered in weeks, not months.</li>
      <li>Superior data security: information is encoded in models, not raw data.</li>
      <li>No need for failure data to detect faults or degradation.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="business">
    <h2>Our Business Models</h2>
    <p>
      MBS licenses proprietary algorithms for CPM, RULE, and AMF. Customers integrate the outputs with dashboards and machine interfaces. For ALSD, customers purchase proprietary designs identified through our simulation work. These are yours — exclusively and confidentially.
